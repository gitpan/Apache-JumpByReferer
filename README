Apache::JumpByReferer version 0.01
==================================

Apache::JumpByReferer is an access phase handler of Apache + mod_perl.
You can block or let the user jump to another URL if the user was coming
from your specified web site.

This handler will check the last-modified time of the "RefererListFile",
and will re-cache the settings when the file was modified after the last
cached time. That is to say, you can rewrite to change your settings.

Write a regular expressions (*REGEX*) of your specified URL in the
"RefererListFile", and join a URL to jump behind the *REGEX* in the
blank(s) if you want to let jump the user. Write and join "Forbidden"
(case insensitive) string behind the *REGEX* in the blank(s) if you
don't want to access to the directory.
